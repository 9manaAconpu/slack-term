The film is divided into five chapters, each with its own style and tone. The first chapter, "Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-Occupied France", introduces the main antagonist, Colonel Hans Landa (Waltz), also known as "The Jew Hunter", who interrogates a French farmer hiding a Jewish family under his floorboards. The second chapter, "Inglourious Basterds", introduces the main protagonist, Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt), who recruits eight Jewish-American soldiers for a special operation to kill Nazis with extreme prejudice. The third chapter, "German Night in Paris", follows Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), the sole survivor of the massacre at the farm, who now runs a cinema in Paris under a new identity. She meets Fredrick Zoller (BrÃ¼hl), a German war hero and movie star, who takes a liking to her and convinces Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth), the Nazi minister of propaganda, to hold the premiere of his propaganda film "Nation's Pride" at her cinema. The fourth chapter, "Operation Kino", follows British agent Lieutenant Archie Hicox (Fassbender), who teams up with German actress and double agent Bridget von Hammersmark (Kruger) and two of the Basterds to infiltrate the premiere and blow up the cinema. The fifth chapter, "Revenge of the Giant Face", depicts the climactic events at the premiere, where Shosanna's plan and the Basterds' plan converge in a bloody and explosive finale.
